## Description

In this repository, you will find the source code of [**Cycle**](https://bygerardvisuals.com/cycle), an installation that addresses the housing situation in Spain in 2025.

Currently, we are living in a time when affordable housing is one of the main concerns for people. There is a decreasing supply of housing at affordable prices, and it is increasingly treated as a financial asset rather than a basic right. At the same time, across the state, there are vacant homes not listed on the market, where selling them at a fair price could help mitigate the current situation.

Could art help address the high cost of housing today?

This work aims to generate pieces based on headlines created for the occasion that reflect collective thoughts. The number of vacant homes scattered throughout the state determines the name and the time it takes to generate each piece. Afterwards, the artworks will be offered for sale to “recover” the housing cost associated with this situation.

To allow everyone to create their works and experiment freely, the code for this piece is made freely and openly available under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL v3)**. This means anyone can use, modify, share, and commercialise both the code and the artworks generated with it, provided that the terms of the license are respected: preserving authorship, sharing any modifications under the same license, and mentioning the origin of the code and its sources.
